# Counterfeit-nvim

Personal nvim configuration

Bootstrapped with nvim kickstart and chris@machine neovim from scratch series

Configuration will hopefully become more unique as I get more experience with neovim and lua.

## Install

Clone the directory directly into the .config folder under the directory /nvim.

command: git clone {url} ~/.config/nvim
